### Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Kaggle projects and competitions! This repository showcases my work in data analysis and predictive modeling using Python. Here, you'll find detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and various prediction models applied to different datasets. Each project is a testament to my learning journey and the application of data science techniques to solve real-world problems.

### Projects Overview

The projects in this repository are broken down into two main sections: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Prediction Models.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Analyzing Global Cancer Death Rate (1990 - 2019)**: This ![project](https://github.com/SandraAsagade/Kaggle/blob/main/CANCER%20DEATH%20RATES/CANCER%20DR.ipynb) involves a comprehensive analysis of global cancer death rates over three decades. The EDA includes visualizations and insights into trends, geographical distributions, and age-specific mortality rates.

### EDA and Prediction Models

- **Customer Churn Rate Analysis and Predicting Customer Churn**: This ![project](https://github.com/SandraAsagade/Kaggle/blob/main/Customer%20Churn/customer-churn-eda-and-prediction.ipynb) combines EDA and predictive modeling to understand the factors contributing to customer churn and to develop models that predict the likelihood of customers leaving a service.

- **Predicting the Likelihood of Titanic Passengers Being Transported or Not**: This ![project](https://github.com/SandraAsagade/Kaggle/blob/main/SPACESHIP_TITANIC/SPACESHIP%20TITANIC.ipynb) involves both EDA and prediction models to determine which passengers were likely to be transported. The analysis includes visualizing passenger demographics and survival rates, followed by building models to predict outcomes based on various features.

Feel free to explore the projects and review the code and analyses. Each project folder contains detailed Jupyter notebooks that document the steps and methodologies used. Thank you for visiting my repository!
